        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Our application was created with people who have allergies in mind. For some, having an allergy 
            to natural elements such as tree, grass, or flower pollen can make going outside lethal. 
            We aim to provide easy-to-access and up-to-date information on pollen conditions, 
            helping users navigate their allergies and plan their activities safely.
