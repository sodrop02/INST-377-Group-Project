# INST-377-Group-Project
group project repo for our inst377 group

to start the backend server:
node index.js

this will start on localhost:3001

to access the api keys, and if you are in my group, do this:
step 1: npm install
that should be it, but just to double check do step 1.5

step 1.5: make sure dotenv is installed in your project directory by doing
npm i dotenv

after that, create a file in your directory with all the files called
.env

in your .env file, add these 2 lines:
API_NINJAS_KEY= API_KEY_HERE
GOOGLE_API_KEY= API_KEY_HERE

replace API_KEY_HERE with the actual api keys
